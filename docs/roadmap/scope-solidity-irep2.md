# Scope: solidity frontend to IREP2 (Phase 8)

Opened per `frontends-to-irep2.md` §6, which requires each of Phases 5-9 to
start with its own scope doc: census, phased decomposition, gates, risks. Phase
5 (jimple) closed at `scope-jimple-irep2.md` §31; Phase 6 (clang-c) is
`scope-clang-c-irep2.md`; Phase 7 (clang-cpp) is `scope-clang-cpp-irep2.md` and
is **not** closed, which matters here for the reason §2 gives.

## 1. Census

### 1.1 The blocker the parent records is stale

`frontends-to-irep2.md` §15.1 records Solidity as *blocked, not zero*: a decline
census got `ERROR: `' is not a goto-binary`, nothing ran, and the note concludes
the suite needs Linux CI. Re-tested 2026-09-11 and it is measurable here.

```
$ grep ENABLE_SOLIDITY build/CMakeCache.txt
ENABLE_SOLIDITY_FRONTEND:BOOL=On
$ ctest -j24 -L esbmc-solidity
99% tests passed, 2 tests failed out of 525
```

The two are not failures: both print `passed but is marked as KNOWNBUG.
Consider reclassifying it as CORE` (`testing_tool.py` exit 77) —
`delegate_shadow_3` and `nested_array_deep_1`, each expecting `^VERIFICATION
SUCCESSFUL$` and getting it, in half a second, so not the timeout that
`KNOWNBUG` silently accepts. They are master drift, and flipping them wants its
own change; they are recorded here because a census that reports "2 failures"
without saying which kind is the §15.1 mistake again.

§15.1's own rule is what makes this census admissible: it must show the thing
under test executed before a zero means anything.

### 1.2 Surface

`src/solidity-frontend`, 23 599 LOC over 25 files:

| File | LOC | Legacy construction sites |
|---|---:|---:|
| `solidity_convert_call.cpp` | 3 682 | 404 |
| `solidity_convert_expr.cpp` | 3 409 | 250 |
| `solidity_convert.h` | 1 129 | 221 |
| `solidity_convert_ref.cpp` | 937 | 89 |
| `solidity_convert_type.cpp` | 1 588 | 86 |
| `solidity_convert_constructor.cpp` | 1 055 | 78 |
| `solidity_convert_stmt.cpp` | 978 | 75 |
| `solidity_convert_decl.cpp` | 1 526 | 73 |
| `solidity_convert_mapping.cpp` | 708 | 70 |
| `solidity_convert_contract.cpp` | 850 | 67 |
| `solidity_convert_tuple.cpp` | 653 | 59 |
| `solidity_convert_builtin.cpp` | 524 | 54 |
| `solidity_convert_modifier.cpp` | 752 | 53 |
| `solidity_convert.cpp` | 1 266 | 51 |
| `solidity_convert_util.cpp` | 1 046 | 36 |
| `solidity_convert_literals.cpp` | 159 | 15 |
| `solidity_grammar.cpp` | 1 804 | **0** |
| `pattern_check.cpp` | 153 | **0** |
| remainder (`typecast`, `language`, headers) | — | 4 |
| **total** | **23 599** | **1 685** |

"Construction sites" counts lines mentioning `exprt`, `typet`, a `code_*t`,
`symbol_expr`, `gen_zero` or `from_integer` — the same rough proxy the parent
used for its 971 and 1 420 figures, not a precise obligation count. The
parent's 1 420 was measured at `f14cd73ff8`; the surface has grown since.

**IREP2 use today: zero.** `grep -c 'expr2tc\|type2tc' *.cpp *.h` over the
whole frontend returns 0, so unlike clang-c (49 sites already native) this
phase has no head start. `solidity_grammar.cpp` is the AST-kind classifier and
constructs no IR at all — the analogue of `clang_c_lexer.cpp` in Phase 6's
§1.1, and it needs no migration.

### 1.3 Corpus

| Suite | Tests |
|---|---|
| `esbmc-solidity` | 525 |

Tests ship a pre-generated `contract.solast` beside `contract.sol`, and the
flags line names both (`--sol contract.sol --contract <Name>`), so `solc` is
not needed to run them. That is why the suite is measurable without the
toolchain §15.1 assumed was required.

## 2. The finding that sets this phase's shape: there is no Solidity adjust pass

`solidity_languaget::typecheck` (`src/solidity-frontend/solidity_language.cpp`)
has four phases — intrinsics, the `sol64` operational models, the converter,
then the adjuster — and the adjuster it runs is **`clang_cpp_adjust`**, Phase
7's subject, not one of its own:

```cpp
  clang_cpp_adjust adjuster(new_context);
  if (adjuster.adjust())
    return true;
```

Two consequences, and they pull in opposite directions.

**The adjust half of this phase is inherited, not owed.** Every arm Phase 7
ports serves Solidity at no extra cost, and none of Solidity's 1 685 sites is
in an adjust pass. Phase 8's own work is entirely in the *converter*.

**Solidity is therefore exposed to every Phase 7 divergence, and is not
currently measuring any of them.** `clang_cpp_language.cpp` gates its adjuster
on `clang-cpp-irep2-adjust-only`; the line above does not, so the flag does not
reach this path — a Solidity test run with it is byte-identical to one run
without (checked on `abi_decode_1`; the claim rests on the source, since one
identical verdict would not distinguish "flag ignored" from "flag made no
difference here").

That makes the first action of this phase cheap and valuable: wire the existing
flag through, and the 525-test Solidity corpus becomes a **second, independent
corpus for Phase 7's pass** — one whose input the C++ frontend never produces,
over a converter with different habits. Phase 7's divergence census has been run
on `esbmc-cpp` only.

### 2.1 The save/restore dance is a seam hazard

Phase 4 of that function saves every library symbol's value as an `exprt`
before adjusting and restores it afterwards, because `clang_cpp_adjust` would
corrupt bodies that `c2goto`'s `clang_c_adjust` already adjusted.
`clang_c_adjust_irep2` writes back only values it changed, and writes them back
through `migrate_expr_back`. So the restore interacts with a different
write-back discipline than it was written against, and any seam loss on a
library body would be masked by the restore rather than observed. This wants a
measurement before the flag is wired, not after.

## 3. Proposed decomposition (not yet executed)

1. **S.1** Wire `clang-cpp-irep2-adjust-only` into
   `solidity_languaget::typecheck` and report the divergence count over the 525
   tests. Measured baseline, no porting. Gated on §2.1's measurement.
2. **S.2** A read-only `migrate` census for the Solidity converter's output, as
   `--clang-cpp-irep2-migrate-census` is for C++: run every value through
   `get_value2()` and report what `migrate_expr` cannot represent. This is the
   only way to price the converter before touching it, and it is the step
   §15.1's void figure was trying to be.
3. **S.3** The converter's construction sites, in the order the census ranks
   them. `solidity_convert_call.cpp` and `solidity_convert_expr.cpp` are 39 %
   of the surface between them.
4. **S.4** Remove the legacy path once S.1's divergence count is zero.

Steps S.1 and S.2 are both measurement, and both are cheap. Neither is
committed to a porting order, deliberately: Phase 6 §60 found the adjuster's
arms to be one strongly-coupled component that could not move singly, and Phase
7 §3 found its pass was not extensible in the way Phase 6 assumed. A census
first is the lesson those two paid for.

## 4. Gates

The parent's §7 gates apply unchanged. Two are worth restating for this phase:

- **A census must show the thing under test executed.** §15.1's "14 tests, 0
  declines" is void because nothing ran. Any figure this doc reports names the
  command that produced it.
- **`KNOWNBUG` and `FUTURE` rows cannot be read as green.** They accept a
  timeout as satisfying the expectation, so a Solidity divergence count must
  separate them out; `grep` for `accepted under KNOWNBUG` before reading a run
  as clean.

## 5. Risks

| # | Risk |
|---|---|
| R1 | This phase's adjust half depends on Phase 7 closing. Wiring the flag before Phase 7's divergences are down exposes Solidity to all of them at once, which is why S.1 is a measurement and not a flip. |
| R2 | The §2.1 restore can mask a seam loss on a library body. A divergence count taken without checking it may be optimistic. |
| R3 | The `sol64` operational models are a second `c2goto`-compiled artefact, adjusted by `clang_c_adjust` at build time. The `building-c-library` exemptions that protect the C models have no Solidity analogue recorded, and Phase 6's name-matched-builtin section found one such exemption already unreachable from the IREP2 pass. |
| R4 | 1 685 sites and zero head start make this the second-largest phase after Python. Its ordering before Python is the parent's §215 judgement and this doc does not revisit it. |
| R5 | The two XPASS rows in §1.1 mean the suite's expectations are drifting from master. A divergence count is only meaningful against a suite whose baseline is green. |

## 6. Next

S.1 and S.2, in that order, each as its own change. Neither ports anything.
