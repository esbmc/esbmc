## 1. The goal, as a measurable bar

Per frontend `F` in {clang-c, clang-cpp, python, solidity, jimple}:

| # | Bar | Command |
|---|---|---|
| B-1 | Legacy type mentions → ~0, modulo enumerated boundary glue | `git grep -P '\b([A-Za-z_]*(exprt\|typet\|codet)\|irept)\b' -- src/F-frontend` |
| B-2 | Symbol-table writes carry IREP2 values only | `grep -rn 'set_type(\|set_value(' src/F-frontend \| grep -vc 2tc` → 0 |
| B-3 | Bodies reach `goto_convert` with no `migrate_*` back-hop | native dispatcher coverage = 100 %, round-trip deleted |
| B-4 | No `#`-attribute escape hatch into a shared pass | W3 removed, not merely seamed |

B-1/B-2 are frontend-local. **B-3 and B-4 are shared** — they are one repo-wide
job each, not five. That asymmetry is the whole shape of this program: do the
two shared jobs once, then the five frontends become largely mechanical.

## 2. Baseline census (measured 2026-08-03, `f14cd73ff8`)

| frontend | legacy mentions | IREP2 (`*2tc`) | LOC | construction state |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| python | 5 547 | 806 | 79 282 | partially native (Part V) |
| clang-c | 971 | 49 | 13 783 | legacy + isolated IREP2 |
| clang-cpp | 626 | **0** | 7 394 | fully legacy |
| solidity | 1 420 | **0** | 23 589 | fully legacy |
| jimple | 176 | **0** | 3 259 | fully legacy |

The three zeros are real: those frontends construct no IREP2 node at all and
rely entirely on `migrate_expr`/`migrate_type` at the symbol-table seam. Note
jimple's 176 is small because the frontend is small, not because it is nearly
done — normalise by LOC before reading these as effort.

## 3. The W1 wall is stale — this is the finding that makes the program tractable

`irep2-migration.md` §V.1's wall table states:

> **W1 (P1)** — IREP2 has the flat goto-level code kinds … but **no structured
> CF kinds** (`ifthenelse`/`while`/`for`/`switch`/`break`/`continue`/`label`).

**That is no longer true and has not been since #5265** ("V.4.0: add structured
control-flow code kinds"). `src/irep2/expr_kinds.inc:129-139` defines
`code_ifthenelse2t`, `code_while2t`, `code_dowhile2t`, `code_for2t`,
`code_switch2t`, `code_break2t`, `code_continue2t`, `code_label2t`,
`code_switch_case2t`, `code_assert2t`, `code_assume2t`. They have forward and
back `migrate` arms (`src/util/irep/migrate.cpp`), and `goto_convert` consumes
them natively via `convert_native_rec`
(`goto-programs/goto_convert_functions.cpp:254`), with a **per-function**
fallback to the legacy round-trip for unsupported shapes — currently ≈78.7 % of
functions native on the `esbmc-cpp` census.

The consequence is large. Every prior "frontends stay legacy" argument rested
partly on W1: a frontend *could not* build a body natively because the
representation for `if`/`while`/`switch` did not exist. It exists. What remains
of W1 is not a representation gap but **dispatcher coverage** — a finite,
enumerable list of shapes `convert_native_rec` returns `false` on. That is
ordinary work with a measurable completion criterion, not an architectural wall.

**Action:** §V.1's W1 row must be corrected in the parent document (§9 below).
Any planning that still treats W1 as "IREP2 cannot represent structured CF" is
working from a stale premise.

## 4. The four walls, re-grounded at `f14cd73ff8`

| Wall | Original statement | State now | Remaining work |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | no structured CF kinds in IREP2 | **dissolved as stated** (§3) | drive `convert_native_rec` to 100 %, then delete the round-trip |
| W2 | `member2t`/`index2t` assert a resolved source | **dissolved as a construction blocker**, with a standing obligation | the relaxation is repo-wide, but it is conditional — see below |
| W3 | `#cpp_type`/`#member_name`/`#cformat` read off legacy nodes by shared passes | **seamed, not removed** (Option D, #6569/#6570) | carriage — §5, the one genuine design problem left |
| W4 | counterexample printer consumes the attributes | untouched, deferred | falls out of W3 if W3 is solved by a typed field |

Two of four walls are gone, one is reduced to a coverage exercise, and one is a
real design problem. That is a materially better starting position than the
Part V close-out implies.

**W2's obligation, stated because it is a per-frontend cost.** The relaxation
(`irep2_expr.h:1549-1570`) permits a `symbol_id` source **only as a transient
pre-resolution state**, and the comment is explicit that "the adjuster MUST
follow it to a struct before symex" — the strong invariant is re-enforced
post-adjust, not dropped. So the *representation* is repo-wide, but the
*obligation* is not: every frontend that builds `member2t`/`index2t` before type
resolution needs a resolve pass of its own, or must reuse one. Python's is
`python_adjust`. Budget one per frontend in Phases 5-9, and note that the assert
is `#ifndef NDEBUG` — an unresolved source will pass a `RelWithDebInfo` build
silently and fail in symex, which is gate G4's reason for existing.

## 5. The one real wall — value-carried metadata (W3 and Solidity's Q-S1)

### 5.1 Why the recorded closures are right about the mechanism

Part III §14 (Q-S1) and `scope-v2-w3-attribute-carriage.md` §3 independently
established the same fact, and it is not in dispute: **these attributes are read
off transient type values with no symbol in scope.** `cpp_expr2string.cpp:138`
reads the type currently being printed, reached recursively through
`convert(src.subtype())`. `solidity_convert_decl.cpp` reads `get_sol_type(t)`
off a local `typet t` before any symbol exists. A side table keyed by symbol id
— §V.2's prescribed design — cannot serve either. That finding stands.

The options considered, and their recorded verdicts:

| Option | Carries with the value? | Recorded verdict |
|---|---|---|
| A — symbol-keyed side table | no | not viable (Q-S1) |
| B — value-bundled wrapper over `type2tc` | yes | viable, rejected on cost; recreates attribute flexibility |
| C — extend `type2t` with a spelling field | yes | rejected: "pushes presentation concerns into the verifier IR" |
| D — encapsulate writers, leave carriage legacy | n/a | **taken**; does not move B-4 |

### 5.2 Option F — a closed typed field, which is not Option C

Both rejections of B and C rest on the same objection: *do not reinstate the
open, string-keyed attribute flexibility IREP2 abolished.* That objection is
correct against a generic map. It does **not** apply to a closed enum, and two
measurements say a closed enum suffices:

- **Solidity's classification is already a closed `enum class`** —
  `SolType` at `solidity-frontend/solidity_grammar.h:484`. It is stringified
  only to cross the `irept` boundary. Restoring it to a typed field removes a
  serialization step rather than adding an escape hatch.
- **`#cpp_type`'s value domain is the C type-keyword set** — the writers emit
  `"bool"`, `"signed_char"`, `"unsigned_char"`, `"void"` and a `c_type` variable
  drawn from the same finite vocabulary. It is an enum wearing a string.

So the third option the record never separated out:

> **Option F.** Add a **closed, typed, optional** classification field to the
> specific `type2t` kinds that need it — not a generic attribute map, not a
> wrapper struct. `enum class c_spelling` on the integer/float kinds;
> `enum class sol_class` on the kinds Solidity tags. Absent by default, ignored
> by every solver backend, exhaustively switchable.

**Why this is legitimate where C was not.** C was framed as pushing
*presentation* concerns into the verifier IR, and for `cpp_expr2string` and
`goto2c/expr2c` that framing is right. But it is incomplete:
`clang_cpp_adjust_expr.cpp:582` uses `#cpp_type` to **build exception type ids
for catch matching**. That is semantics, not presentation — a C++ program's
observable behaviour depends on it. Metadata that catch-matching depends on
belongs in the typed IR by the migration's own governing rule that verification
correctness outranks implementation convenience. The presentation readers then
ride along for free.

**The honest price**, which must not be glossed: IREP2's type system stops being
purely structural. Two types identical in width and signedness may now differ in
a spelling field. Every equality, hashing and canonicalisation path over
`type2t` must decide whether the field participates — and the answer is almost
certainly **no** (it must not, or `long` and `long long` stop unifying in the
solver and verdicts change). That asymmetry is a sharp edge and needs an
explicit invariant plus a test that pins it.

**Option F is a spike before it is a plan** (Phase 0 below). If the equality
asymmetry proves unmanageable, fall back to Option B for Solidity only and
accept that B-4 closes for C/C++ but not Solidity.

## 6. Phased program

Ordered by dependency. Phases 1 and 2 are shared and unlock everything else;
5-9 are per-frontend and parallelisable once 1 and 2 land.

### Phase 0 — Option F spike (gate for the whole B-4 half)
Prototype `enum class c_spelling` on `signedbv_type2t`/`unsignedbv_type2t`.
Answer three questions and stop: does the field participate in `type2t`
equality/hash (expected: no)? Does exception catch-matching still work off the
typed field? Does the whole `esbmc-cpp` suite hold verdict **and
counterexample-text** parity? Deliverable: a go/no-go with measurements.
*Accept:* a recorded answer either way. A no-go re-routes §5.2 to Option B, it
does not stall the program — Phases 1, 3-9 are independent of B-4.

### Phase 1 — drive `convert_native_rec` to 100 % (closes W1, shared)
Instrument the dispatcher to log every `(kind, shape)` it declines, run the full
corpus, and work the resulting histogram down. This is the highest-value phase:
it is mechanical, measurable, benefits all five frontends at once, and its
completion criterion is a number reaching zero.
*Accept:* 0 fallbacks corpus-wide; then delete the round-trip and the fallback
path in the same PR that proves it unreachable.

### Phase 2 — W3 carriage removal (closes B-4, shared)
Only if Phase 0 says go. Land `c_spelling`/`sol_class` as typed fields, repoint
the four readers, delete the `irept` accessors. Option D already gave one
repoint-point per attribute, so this is now a small diff at a single seam — the
work Option D was explicitly designed to make cheap.

### Phase 3 — finish the Python flip
Phases 2-3 of `scope-coupled-arith-assign-conversion.md`, plus the two ownerless
mechanisms that block it (§9.4's second mechanism; the array-typecast class of
§14). Each needs its own scope doc. Python is the pathfinder: it is the only
frontend with construction experience, so its remaining defects are the ones the
other four will hit.

### Phase 4 — extract the reusable construction kit
Before touching a second frontend, factor what Python learned into shared
helpers: the width-reconciliation idiom (`c_implicit_typecast_arithmetic` on
`expr2tc`), the resolved-source `ns.follow` pattern, the operand-surgery recipe.
Without this, four frontends re-derive the same lessons at four times the cost.

### Phases 5-9 — per-frontend migration, in this order
**5. jimple** (176 mentions, 3 259 LOC) — smallest surface, no operational-model
complication, lowest blast radius. The pathfinder for the kit.
**6. clang-c** (971, already 49 IREP2) — has a partial head start.
**7. clang-cpp** (626) — small but highest semantic density; owns catch-matching
and `clang_cpp_adjust`, which every other frontend's output passes through.
**8. solidity** (1 420) — gated on Phase 2's `sol_class` outcome. If Phase 0 said
no-go, this is where the program's scope is formally cut.
**9. python** (5 547) — largest, and deliberately last so it inherits every
lesson, exactly as §V.1 reframed it.

Each of 5-9 opens its own `scope-<frontend>-irep2.md` at start, following the
established scope-doc pattern: census, phased decomposition, gates, risks.

## 7. Gates (every phase)

| # | Gate |
|---|---|
| G1 | Verdict parity on the affected suites, dual-solver (Bitwuzla + Z3) |
| G2 | Counterexample **text** parity — asserted verbatim by `test.desc` regexes; W3/W4 readers make this load-bearing |
| G3 | `--goto-functions-only` A/B, normalised per the recorded harness rules (§8) |
| G4 | Asserts-on (`DebugOpt`) build — `assert_*_consistency` is `#ifndef NDEBUG` and a `RelWithDebInfo` build compiles it out; ill-formed IR passed every local gate once already |
| G5 | `esbmc-solidity` rides **Linux CI** — macOS has no `solc` and stubbed `sol64` models |

**Inherited harness rules — non-optional.** Every census on this track has been
invalidated at least once by harness artifacts. Reuse them verbatim:

1. Normalise the whole temp-path segment (`s@/esbmc[-._][^/ ]*@/TMPD@g`), not
   individual prefixes — four spellings exist; partial normalisation reports
   ~90 % false divergence.
2. Strip timing lines (`completed in:|time:|Runtime|Elapsed`) — 46 false
   divergences out of 106 from `0.000s` vs `0.001s` alone.
3. Exclude or serialize `--k-induction-parallel` tests — UNSTABLE against
   themselves.
4. Skip tests whose `test.desc` already passes the flag under test — boost
   throws `multiple_occurrences`.
5. Minimum-size guard (`< 200 bytes → SKIP`) — two collapsed error lines
   otherwise count as a match.
6. Sample dense and unbiased; stride-20 missed a 0.5 % defect rate entirely.
7. **When a divergence survives, run the baseline against itself before
   attributing it to the patch.** That control is what settled `cpp_sum_class`.
8. **Probe the invariant you depend on, not a proxy for it**, and prove the probe
   fires on known-bad input before trusting a zero. A probe measuring a narrower
   condition than its invariant reported "0 firings" for a violation that CI then
   caught.

## 8. Risks

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Option F's spelling field leaks into `type2t` equality and silently changes verdicts | Phase 0 answers this first; explicit invariant + a pinning test |
| R2 | Five frontends re-derive Python's lessons independently | Phase 4 exists solely to prevent this; do not start Phase 5 before it |
| R3 | Partial migration is tracked as progress | B-1..B-4 are all-or-nothing per frontend, as V.5's deferral argument established: migrating 10 of ~159 kinds removes **zero** back-hops |
| R4 | Solidity's metadata proves genuinely open, not enum-shaped | Cut scope to four frontends; record it, do not let it stall the rest |
| R5 | The program stalls mid-way, leaving frontends in a worse hybrid state than pure legacy | Each phase is independently valuable and independently revertible; Phase 1 alone is a net win even if nothing else lands |

## 9. What this reverses, and required parent-document edits

Three recorded conclusions are superseded **by decision**:

- **B1** (Part I, "frontends stay legacy") — reopened.
- **Part III §14** ("the Solidity frontend stays legacy by design") — reopened,
  conditional on Phase 0.
- **Part V's V.1a/V.2/V.6 closures** — reopened; V.2's blocker is now Option F,
  not the refuted Option A.

And one is superseded **by fact**, independent of the goal change:

- **§V.1's W1 row is stale** (§3). It should be corrected regardless of whether
  this program is prosecuted, because it misstates the tree.

## 10. Honest sizing

No total estimate is given, deliberately — the Part V record shows what happens
when a multi-phase program is sized before its keystone spike returns. What can
be sized:

| item | estimate | confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 spike | days | high — bounded, one question |
| Phase 1 (dispatcher to 100 %) | weeks | medium — histogram is measurable but its tail is unknown until instrumented |
| Phase 2 (W3 removal, post-Option D) | days | high — one seam, four readers |
| Phases 5-9 | unknown until Phase 4 | low — Phase 5 (jimple) is the calibration run |

**The recommended first action is Phase 1, not Phase 0.** It is independent of
the Option F question, benefits all five frontends whether or not the rest of
the program proceeds, and its output — the declined-shape histogram — is the
single most informative artefact available about how far frontend construction
actually is from native.
