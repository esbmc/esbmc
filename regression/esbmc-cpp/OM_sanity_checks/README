Test suite to perform sanity checks on ESBMC's OMs for C++ verification. It works in two-ways:
1. Make sure the code changes in an ESBMC's OM doesn't generate PARSE ERRORs
2. Make sure the code changes in clang-cpp frontend doesn't affect the parsing of ESBMC's OMs

Eeach TC corresponds to one ESBMC C++ OM.

Pass criteria:
  - No parse errors and got "VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL"
