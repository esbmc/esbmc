#[[
The build system have flags based on the current system, this may 
be for finding executables or custom links

The global variables that all modules NEED to define are:

- LIBGOMP_LIB: Flags to link libgomp (used by Z3);
- OS_FLEX_SMTLIB_FLAGS: Flags used for Flex targets. This may add defines exclusive to
    the OS (for smtlib);
- OS_X86_INCLUDE_FOLDER: Path to the default multiarch headers of the system,
    when generating goto models some of those are in 32bits. This is were they
    will find the headers by adding -I <folder>;
- OS_C2GOTO_FLAGS: Flags used by c2goto. This may add defines exclusive for the
    OS;
- OS_Z3_LIBS: Flags used by Z3 link;
