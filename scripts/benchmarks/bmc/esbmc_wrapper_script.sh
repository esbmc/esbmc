# The '-D' options are a series of workarounds for some problems encountered:
#  -DLDV_ERROR=ERROR  maps the error label in the 'regression' dir to 'ERROR',
#                     so that we don't have to parse the property file,
#  -Dassert=notassert maps the error function in 'seq-mthreaded' directory to
#                     be named 'notassert', as giving a body for the 'assert'
#                     function conflicts with our internal library
#  -D_Bool=int        works around the presence of some booleans inside
#                     bitfields in some linux-based benchmarks.
