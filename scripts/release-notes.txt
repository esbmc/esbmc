*** Version 2.0.0
+ Released ESBMC open source at https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc
+ Build with autoconf
+ Adjust union implementation: because SMT does not have a good way of
  representing unions, we now allocate a byte array as storage for unions, and
  force all union accesses to be performed through pointers. The dereference
  layer handles the decomposition of these accesses to byte array accesses.
  This seems to work well; the only limitation is that assignments of type
  union become assignments of type array, which the dereference layer can't
  handle. This will be fixed in a future release
+ Support assignments with structure type better, and dereferences that
  evaluate to a structure
+ Fix a number of byte-order inaccuracies. The "byte_extract" and update ireps
  will now only operate on scalars; the pointer layer handles all other
  circumstances where the byte model representation is required
- For this release, K-Induction support is disabled. Please use a previous
  version for kinduction.

*** Version 1.25
+ Bugfixes for the k-induction implementation.
+ Boolector is now the default solver.
+ Improved the C++ parser and template. 
+ Decreased memory usage.

*** Version 1.23
+ Bugfixes for the k-induction implementation.
+ Added the ability to run each step of the k-induction process concurrently.
  --k-induction-parallel will run the base, forward condition, and inductive
  step in separate concurrent subprocesses.

*** Version 1.22
TACAS14 competition release.
+ Substantially altered the memory model. The majority of dereferencing logic
  now occurs while the SSA program is produced (and thus is visible in
  --program-only), rather than at the solver level.
+ Unaligned dereferences will now produce an assertion failure; disable them
  with --no-align-check
+ Expunged a large variety amount of the stringly-typed internal representation
+ Updated Z3 api to 4.0, to use their reference counting approach and new
  solver API. We recommend using Z3 4.0 itself, as later versions seem to
  exhibit a performance regression.

*** Version 1.21.1
+ Fixed an option-passing failure present in 1.21, that led to K-induction
+ not operating correclty

*** Version 1.21
+ Enhance support for C++ model checking
+ Switch LTL modelling to support checking multiple property truth values.

+ Support more of the pthreads library (pthread_join).
+ Fix an issue with guards not being shared between threads.
  - Under certain circumstances, a condition guarding a visible instruction is
    not applied to other threads after a context switch, leading to impossible
    counterexamples.
+ Fixed a problem where some dynamically allocated objects allocation status
  became incorrect.
