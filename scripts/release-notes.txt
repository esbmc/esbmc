 - We do not add data race checks for structs and pointers.

*** Version 1.7 ***
Date: 22/07/2010
+ Enhancements

   and condition checking of "for" loops;
 - Fixed a bug related to function pointers;
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (i.e., v2.8).
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add data race checks for structs and pointers.

*** Version 1.6 ***
Date: 03/06/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (v2.7);
 - The UW procedure is able to find deadlocks.
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add data race checks for pointers (i.e., we miss data race
   bugs originated from pointers).

*** Version 1.5 ***
Date: 14/05/2010
+ New Features
 - Support for data race detection (use the option --data-races-detection).
+ Enhancements
 - Improved the command-line interface: (i) we provide more details about the
   UW algorithm in the console and (ii) we also allow the user to disable the 
   deadlock detection through the command line (thus simplifying the formula
   to be sent to the SMT solver);
 - Minor bug fixes related to the pthread_join function and the UW procedure
   (now we can support thousands of control literals). 
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add deadlock assertions to be checked using the UW procedure;
 - We do not add data race assertions for pointers (i.e., we miss data race
   bugs originating from pointers).

*** Version 1.4.1 ***
Date: 10/05/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Minor bug fixes related to the concurrency stuffs.
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (v2.6).

   more than 500 control literals.

*** Version 1.4 ***
Date: 25/04/2010
+ New Features
