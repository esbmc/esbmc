+ New option to unwind loops at goto level.

*** Version 2.0.0
+ Released ESBMC open source at https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc.
+ Build with autoconf.
+ Adjust union implementation: because SMT does not have a good way of.
  representing unions, we now allocate a byte array as storage for unions, and
  force all union accesses to be performed through pointers. The dereference
  layer handles the decomposition of these accesses to byte array accesses.
  This seems to work well; the only limitation is that assignments of type
  union become assignments of type array, which the dereference layer can't
  handle. This will be fixed in a future release.
+ Support assignments with structure type better, and dereferences that
  evaluate to a structure.
+ Fix a number of byte-order inaccuracies. The "byte_extract" and update ireps
  will now only operate on scalars; the pointer layer handles all other.
  circumstances where the byte model representation is required
- For this release, K-Induction support is disabled. Please use a previous
  version for kinduction.

*** Version 1.22
TACAS14 competition release.
+ Substantially altered the memory model. The majority of dereferencing logic
  now occurs while the SSA program is produced (and thus is visible in
  --program-only), rather than at the solver level.
+ Unaligned dereferences will now produce an assertion failure; disable them
  with --no-align-check.
+ Expunged a large variety amount of the stringly-typed internal representation
+ Updated Z3 api to 4.0, to use their reference counting approach and new
  solver API. We recommend using Z3 4.0 itself, as later versions seem to
  exhibit a performance regression.

  became incorrect.

   structs reported by Jeremy;
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (i.e., v2.13).

*** Version 1.12 ***
Date: 08/11/2010
+ New Feature
 - Output verification conditions into the SMT-lib logics QF_AUFBV
   and QF_AUFLIRA (use the option --qf_aufbv or qf_auflira followed by
   --outfile file.smt).
+ Enhancements
 - Minor bug fixes related to the ANSI-C front-end and dynamic memory allocation.

*** Version 1.11 ***
Date: 18/10/2010
+ New Features
 - Preliminary support for detecting memory leaks.

*** Version 1.10 ***
Date: 13/10/2010
+ New Feature
 - Support for static partial order reduction (use the
   option --no-por to disable it);
+ Enhancements
 - Fixed one bug related to context-switch before array updates;
 - Fixed one bug related to pointer typecast reported by Jie Gao.

*** Version 1.9 ***
Date: 17/09/2010
+ New Feature
 - Support for checking atomicity violation at visible statements
   (use the option --atomicity-check).

*** Version 1.8 ***
Date: 06/09/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Included an option --control-flow-test to allow context switch before
   control flow tests;
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (i.e., v2.11).
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add data race checks for structs and pointers.

*** Version 1.7.1 ***
Date: 26/07/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Fixed one bug reported by Jie Gao related to dynamic memory allocation.
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add data race checks for structs and pointers.

*** Version 1.7 ***
Date: 22/07/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Fixed two bugs reported by Jie Gao related to atomicity violation
   and condition checking of "for" loops;
 - Fixed a bug related to function pointers;
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (i.e., v2.8).
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add data race checks for structs and pointers.

*** Version 1.6 ***
Date: 03/06/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (v2.7);
 - The UW procedure is able to find deadlocks.
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add data race checks for pointers (i.e., we miss data race
   bugs originated from pointers).

*** Version 1.5 ***
Date: 14/05/2010
+ New Features
 - Support for data race detection (use the option --data-races-detection).
+ Enhancements
 - Improved the command-line interface: (i) we provide more details about the
   UW algorithm in the console and (ii) we also allow the user to disable the
   deadlock detection through the command line (thus simplifying the formula
   to be sent to the SMT solver);
 - Minor bug fixes related to the pthread_join function and the UW procedure
   (now we can support thousands of control literals).
+ Known Issues
 - We do not add deadlock assertions to be checked using the UW procedure;
 - We do not add data race assertions for pointers (i.e., we miss data race
   bugs originating from pointers).

*** Version 1.4.1 ***
Date: 10/05/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Minor bug fixes related to the concurrency stuffs.
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (v2.6).
+ Known Issues
 - The UW procedure does not work for multi-threaded C programs that require
   more than 500 control literals.

*** Version 1.4 ***
Date: 25/04/2010
+ New Features
 - Support for context-bounded model checking (use option --context-switch nr);
 - Support for detecting the potential for deadlock;
 - Detection of abandoned locks;
 - Detection of lost signals;
 - Support for creating dynamically threads, mutexes, and condition variables.
+ Known Issues
 - The UW procedure does not work for multi-threaded C programs that require
   more than 500 control literals.

*** Version 1.3.2 ***
Date: 08/04/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Minor bug fixes related to concurrency reported by Byron Cook.

*** Version: 1.3.1 ***
Date: 29/03/2010
+ Enhancements
 - Minor bug fixes related to dynamic memory allocation;
 - Improvement in the command-line interface;
 - Integration of a new version of the SMT solver Z3 (v2.5).

*** Version: 1.3 ***
Date: 13/03/2010
+ New features:
 - Lazy exploration of the threads interleavings;
 - Generate one single formula using the schedule recording approach to verify multi-threaded programs;
 - Generate underapproximation and widening models for the multi-threaded programs;
 - Support for concurrent C programs with shared memory;
 - Support for synchronization primitives with mutexes and conditions;
 - Detection of global deadlock with mutexes and conditions;
 - Additional support for atomic sections through the functions __ESBMC_atomic_begin() and __ESBMC_atomic_end().
