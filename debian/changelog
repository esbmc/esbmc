esbmc (8.0.0+fix1-1) noble; urgency=medium

  * Merge latest changes from master branch (ESBMC v8.0.0)
  * Update orig.tar.gz to match merged master branch
  * ESBMC v8.0 release
  * This major release of ESBMC v8.0 delivers Python frontend enhancements
    with comprehensive type system improvements, advanced string handling,
    and dictionary support. The release includes improvements in verification
    capabilities, simplifier optimizations, support for witness validation,
    and enhanced C/C++ verification.
  * Python Frontend: Type system enhancements (Union types, TypedDict,
    Literal, improved type inference), comprehensive dictionary support,
    extensive string operations (split, join, replace, upper, lower, strip,
    etc.), list and collection operations, set operations, tuple support,
    built-in functions (all, any, divmod, chr, int), class and object
    support, nested functions, import system improvements, math module
    support, exception handling, non-deterministic values, and code quality
    improvements.
  * C/C++ Verification: Function contract support, operational models
    improvements, C++23 support updates, pointer analysis fixes, and
    optimizations.
  * Verification Features: Correctness witness validation, loop handling
    improvements, coverage and testing enhancements, simplifier enhancements,
    and SMT backend improvements.
  * Build System: Boost 1.90 compatibility, fmt usage updates, CHERI build
    process simplification, and various build fixes.
  * Infrastructure: CI improvements, documentation consolidation, website
    implementation, and testing infrastructure enhancements.
  * Add clang and libclang-common runtime dependencies for C/C++ verification
    (clang binary and headers are needed at runtime to parse C/C++ code)
