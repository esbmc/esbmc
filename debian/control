Description: Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker
 ESBMC is a context-bounded model checker for the verification of
 single- and multi-threaded C/C++ programs. It can automatically verify
 both predefined safety properties (e.g., bounds check, pointer safety,
 overflow) and user-defined program assertions.
 .
 ESBMC supports the Clang compiler as a frontend and uses SMT solvers
 to perform the verification. This package includes support for the Z3
 SMT solver and Python frontend. The ast2json dependency is bundled
 in the package and does not require external installation.
