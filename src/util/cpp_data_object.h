/**
 * @class cpp_data_object
 * @brief Provides utility functions for handling C++ data objects.
 *
 * A data object in C++ is not an official term, but it is used here to refer to
 * a struct that represents the _non-virtual_ part of a C++ class.
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```
 * class A {
 *  int x;
 * };
 *
 * Then an object for A would contain only a single field,
 * "A@data_object", which is a struct with a single field "x".
 * If there is a class B that inherits from A, then the object
 * for B would contain a single field "B@data_object", which
 * contains a field "A@data_object" nested in it.
 * A class `C` that inherits from `B` and `virtual A` would contain
 * two fields: "B@data_object" and "A@data_object" (for the virtual base).
 * Note: we do some liberal casting between the class "A" and "A@data_object".
 * In a strict C++ sense this is potentially UB, but we are not bound by the
 * C++ standard in our internal representation.
 *
