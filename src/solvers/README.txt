This directory contains the ESBMC SMT reduction code. The primary purpose is
to reduce SSA programs that contain expressions over integers, arrays,
pointers, structures, complex byte operations, and much more, down to an SMT
formula.

The best reference is the boolector backend; see
solvers/boolector. There's also some documentation on how the new solver
backends are arranged in solvers/smt/smt_conv.h in a file comment. There
are also (mostly) comments about the purpose of each class in that file.
A brief overview:

There are three main abstract classes: smt_convt, smt_ast, and smt_sort.
Each solver backend subclasses these classes into their own, for
example, boolector_convt, btor_smt_ast, etc. (The boolector backend
doesn't subclass smt_sort as it's unnecessary). The 'conv' class is
supposed to represent an instance of the solver; the ast class holds
instances of pieces of SMT ast (functions, constants, whatever), and the
sort class holds instances of sorts.

Literals / constants are made with methods like 'mk_smt_bool',
'mk_smt_int' and so forth, as implemented by the convt class. They
return ast's. There's a similar mechanism for making sorts, mk_sort [0].

All the main work happens in the 'mk_func_app' method: it takes a
function kind, some ast arguments to operate on, and the
resulting sort. The solver 'convt' class takes the ast arguments,
creates the function application in the solver, wraps it in a new ast
object, and returns it. See boolector_convt::mk_func_app to see that
this is fairly simple: it casts smt_ast's to its own btor_smt_ast
class, then calls boolector_add, boolector_sub, etc, to create function
applications. Those are then wrapped via the new_ast method and returned.

The point of this interface is to avoid converting big, complicated,
possibly non-SMT expressions in the solver backend -- that's all handled
in the (abstract) smt_convt class. All the backend has to do is
implement the solver-specific parts of a general SMT solver, i.e.
something that constructs formulae out of function applications.

There's some funkyness to do with array's and tuples: most SMT solvers
don't support tuples, and I tried to keep the door open for SAT solvers
by abstracting arrays. There are two "interfaces" in
solvers/smt/smt_array.h and solvers/smt/smt_tuple.h, which solvers have
to implement if they support arrays or tuples; plus some virtual methods
in smt_ast. It's worth reading up on C++ virtual interface classes
before dealing with this (tl;dr, like java interfaces, but worse. It's
essentially passing a vtable around).

Finally, there's some boilerplate in solvers/solve.cpp for creating
solvers. The idea is to implement the factory pattern for solver
creation, avoiding general-esbmc code having to touch solver-specific stuff.

[0] It's variardic; I thought that'd be useful then; see
boolector_convt::mk_sort for an implementation. In reality, it could have
been more useful.
