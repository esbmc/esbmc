/** @file smt_conv.h
 *  SMT conversion tools and utilities.
 *  smt_convt is the base class for everything that attempts to convert the
 *  contents of an SSA program into something else, generally SMT or SAT based.
 *
 *  The class itself does various accounting and structuring of the conversion,
 *  however the challenge is that as we convert the SSA program into anything
 *  else, we must deal with the fact that expressions in ESBMC are somewhat
 *  bespoke, and don't follow any particular formalism or logic. Therefore
 *  a lot of translation has to occur to reduce it to the desired logic, a
 *  process that Kroening refers to in CBMC as 'Flattenning'.
 *
 *  The conceptual data flow is that an SSA program held by
 *  symex_target_equationt is converted into a series of boolean propositions
 *  in some kind of solver context, the handle to which are objects of class
 *  smt_ast. These are then asserted as appropriate (or conjoined or
 *  disjuncted), after which the solver may be asked whether the formula is
 *  or not. If it is, the value of symbols in the formula may be retrieved
 *  from the solver.
 *
 *  To do that, the user must allocate a solver converter object, which extends
 *  the class smt_convt. Current, create_solver_factory will do this, in the
 *  factory-pattern manner (ish). Each solver converter implements all the
 *  abstract methods of smt_convt. When handed an expression to convert,
 *  smt_convt deconstructs it into a series of function applications, which it
 *  creates by calling various abstract methods implemented by the converter
 *  (in particular mk_func_app).
 *
 *  The actual function applications are in smt_ast objects. Following the
 *  SMTLIB definition, these are basically a term.
 *
 *  In no particular order, the following expression translation problems exist
 *  and are solved at various layers:
 *
 *  For all solvers, the following problems are flattenned:
 *    * The C memory address space
 *    * Representation of pointer types
 *    * Casts
 *    * Byte operations on objects (extract/update)
 *    * FixedBV representation of floats
 *    * Unions -> something else
 *
 *  While these problems are supported by some SMT solvers, but are flattened
 *  in others (as SMT doesn't support these):
 *    * Bitvector integer overflow detection
 *    * Tuple representation (and arrays of them)
 *
 *  SAT solvers have the following aspects flattened:
 *    * Arrays (using Kroenings array decision procedure)
 *    * First order logic bitvector calculations to boolean formulas
 *    * Boolean formulas to CNF
 *
 *  If you find yourself having to make the SMT translation translate more than
 *  these things, ask yourself whether what you're doing is better handled at
 *  a different layer, such as symbolic execution. A nonexhaustive list of these
 *  include:
 *    * Anything involving pointer dereferencing at all
 *    * Anything that considers the control flow guard at any point
 *    * Pointer liveness or dynamic allocation consideration
 *
 *  A reasonable amount of SMT conversion complexity comes from the
 *  eccentricities of different solvers. This is a necessary part of working in
 *  the tar pit.

/** The base SMT-conversion class/interface.
 *  smt_convt handles a number of decisions that must be made when
 *  deconstructing ESBMC expressions down into SMT representation. See
 *  smt_conv.h for more high level documentation of this.
 *
 *  The basic flow is thus: a class that can create SMT formula in some solver
 *  subclasses smt_convt, implementing abstract methods, in particular
 *  mk_func_app. The rest of ESBMC then calls convert with an expression, and
 *  this class deconstructs it into a series of applications, as documented by
 *  the smt_func_kind enumeration. These are then created via mk_func_app or
 *  some more specific method calls. Boolean sorted ASTs are then asserted
 *  into the solver context.
 *
 *  The exact lifetime of smt asts here is currently undefined, unfortunately,
 *  although smt_convt posesses a cache, so they generally have a reference
 *  in there. This will probably be fixed in the future.
 *
 *  In theory this class supports pushing and popping of solver contexts,
 *  although of course that depends too on the subclass supporting it. However,
 *  this hasn't really been tested since everything here was rewritten from
 *  The Old Way, so don't trust it.
 *
 *  While mk_func_app is supposed to be the primary interface to making SMT
 *  function applications, in some cases we want to introduce some
 *  abstractions, and this becomes unweildy. Thus, tuple and array operations
 *  are performed via virtual function calls. By default, array operations are
 *  then passed through to mk_func_app, while tuples are decomposed into sets
 *  of variables which are then created through mk_func_app. If this isn't
 *  what a solver wants to happen, it can override this and handle that itself.
 *  The idea is that, in the manner of metaSMT, you can then compose a series
 *  of subclasses that perform the desired amount of flattening, and then work
 *  from there. (Some of this is still WIP though).
 *
 *  NB: the whole smt_asts-are-const situation needs to be resolved too.
