/** @file smt_tuple.cpp
 * So, the SMT-encoding-with-no-tuple-support. SMT itself doesn't support
 * tuples, but we've been pretending that it does by using Z3 almost
 * exclusively (which does support tuples). So, we have to find some way of
 * supporting:
 *
 *  1) Tuples
 *  2) Arrays of tuples
 *  3) Arrays of tuples containing arrays
 *
 * 1: In all circumstances we're either creating, projecting, or updating,
 *    a set of variables that are logically grouped together as a tuple. We
 *    can generally just handle that by linking up a tuple to the actual
 *    variable that we want. To do this, we create a set of symbols /underneath/
 *    the symbol we're dealing with, corresponding to the field name. So a tuple
 *    with fields a, b, and c, with the symbol name "faces" would create:
 *
 *      main::1::faces.a
 *      main::1::faces.b
 *      main::1::faces.c
 *
 *    As variables with the appropriate type. Project / update redirects
 *    expressions to deal with those symbols. Equality is similar.
 *
 *    It gets more complicated with ite's though, as you can't
 *    nondeterministically switch between symbol prefixes like that. So instead
 *    we create a fresh new symbol, and create an ite for each member of the
 *    tuple, binding it into the new fresh symbol if it's enabling condition
 *    is true.
 *
 *    The basic design feature here is that in all cases where we have something
 *    of tuple type, the AST is actually a deterministic symbol that we hang
 *    additional bits of name off as appropriate.
 *
 *  2: For arrays of tuples, we do almost exactly as above, but all the new
 *     variables that are used are in fact arrays of values. Then when we
 *     perform an array operation, we either select the relevant values out into
 *     a fresh tuple, or decompose a tuple into a series of updates to make.
 *
 *  3: Tuples of arrays of tuples are currently unimplemented. But it's likely
 *     that we'll end up following 2: above, but extending the domain of the
 *     array to contain the outer and inner array index. Ugly but works
 *     (inspiration came from the internet / stackoverflow, reading other
 *     peoples work where they've done this).
 *
 * All these things could probably be made more efficient by rewriting the
 * expressions that are being converted, so that we can for example discard
 * any un-necessary equalities or assertions. However, in the meantime, this
 * slower approach works.
