/**
 *  Class representing a global state of variables and threads.
 *  This is made up of two parts: first a "level 2" state and value_set pair
 *  of objects, recording the SSA numbers of variables assigned to, and
 *  what particular pointers can possibly point at (the value set). Then,
 *  there's a vector of goto_symex_statet's recording a set of threads and
 *  their state (call stack, program counter).
 *
 *  We also contain a few things that technically should be in
 *  reachability_treet, such as DFS_traversed recording what context switches
 *  have been taken.
 *
 *  A large amount of functionality is implemented by extending goto_symext.
 *  The idea is that reachability_treet symex_step's this object until we
 *  notify it about a context switch point. We catch some threading-specific
 *  instructions in execution_statet::symex_step, and pass the rest to
 *  goto_symext::symex_step. And rather than spraying hooks over goto_symext to
 *  detect context switch points, we override a few virtual functions and pass
 *  the operations being observed back up to reachability_treet.
 *
 *  Some circumstances require goto_symext fetching data from execution_statet,
 *  such as fetching our thread number or suchlike, or creating a new thread.
 *  These are handled through intrinsic function calls.
