/**
 *  Class to explore states reachable through threading.
 *  Runs an execution_statet that explores code containing threading functions,
 *  and when notified of context-switch generating operations, attempts to
 *  interleave threads in all possible ways.
 *
 *  To do this, the primary piece of information stored is a stack of
 *  execution_statets, with each ex_state representing a context switch point
 *  reached. A vector<bool> in each ex_state represents which context switches
 *  from this path have been explored already.
 *
 *  The algorithm is to run until the program completes, then feed the trace
 *  to the caller. From then on, when asked to generate a new trace we:
 *
 *    -# Remove the final ex_state from the stack
 *    -# Move to the new final ex_state on the stack
 *    -# Inspect whether we've explored all switches from this state.
 *      If yes, goto 1
 *    -# Pick a context switch to take from the current state, mark as explored
 *    -# Duplicate the final ex_state onto the end of the stack
 *    -# Move to the new end of stack; make the ex_state take the context
 *      switch we picked.
 *    -# Continue symbolic execution from here. Fin.
 *
 *  There are various scheduling possiblities. The default is depth-first
 *  search, where we just follow the algorithm above and return all the traces
 *  to the caller. The "schedule" way combines all paths into one trace, which
 *  is then solved once. Round-robin switches to the next thread in the set of
 *  threads when a context switch point occurs.
 *
 *  Some kind of scheduling interface/api would be good for the future.
