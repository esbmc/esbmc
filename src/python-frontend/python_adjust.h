/// V.1k (b) IREP2-native Python adjuster (phases B.0–B.2).
///
/// Replaces, for the Python frontend, the legacy `clang_cpp_adjust` round-trip
/// on Python output (`python_language.cpp`). It walks each code symbol's IREP2
/// value (`symbolt::get_value2()`) and follows a transient `symbol_type2t`
/// `member2t`/`index2t` source to its resolved `struct_type2t`/`array_type2t`
/// (the V.1k "two-phase source invariant": relaxed at construction, re-enforced
/// here before symex) — covering both a plain instance source and a
/// dereferenced instance pointer.
///
/// Wired into `python_languaget::typecheck` behind `--python-irep2-adjust`
/// (default off ⇒ byte-identical): it runs after `clang_cpp_adjust` and, until
/// the converter emits transient sources pre-adjust, resolves nothing — so the
/// path is dead-but-tested, mirroring the "add the machinery, prove it inert,
/// wire it later" pattern (esbmc/esbmc#5265). `#cpp_type`/`#member_name`
/// carriage and dropping the legacy hop remain later phases (B.4/B.5). See
/// `docs/irep2-migration.md`, section "V.1k (b)-adjuster".

  /// are not adjusted — the legacy adjust() completes all `is_type` symbols
