/** @file dereference.h
 *  The dereferencing code's purpose is to take a symbol with pointer type that
 *  is being dereferenced, and translate it to an expression representing the
 *  values it read or wrote to/from. Note that dereferences can be
 *  'dereference2t' expressions, or indexes that have a base with pointer type.
 *
 *  The inputs to this process are an expression that contains a dereference
 *  that is to be translated, and a value_sett object that contains the set of
 *  references that pointers may point at.
 *
 *  The output is an expression referring that nondeterministically evaluates
 *  to the piece of data that the dereference points at. This (usually) takes
 *  the shape of a large chain of 'if' expressions, with appropriate guards to
 *  switch between which data object the pointer points at, according to the
 *  model that the SAT solver is building. If the pointer points at something
 *  unknown (or dereferencing fails), then it evalates to a 'failed symbol', a
 *  free variable that isn't used anywhere else.
 *
 *  The dereferencing process also outputs a series of dereference assertions,
 *  the failure of which indicate that the dereference performed is invalid in
 *  some way, and that the data used  (almost certainly) ends up being a free
 *  variablea free variable. These are recorded by calling methods in the
 *  dereference_callbackt object. Assertions can be disabled with the
 *  --no-pointer-check and --no-align-check options, but code modelled then
 *  relies on undefined behaviour.
 *
 *  There are four steps to the dereferencing process:
 *   1) Interpretation of the expression surrounding the dereference. The
 *      presence of tertiary operators, short-circuit logic and so forth can
 *      affect whether a dereference is performed, and thus whether assertions
 *      fire. Identifying index/member operations applied also helps to simplify
 *      the resulting dereference.
 *   2) Collect data objects that the dereferenced pointer points at, the offset
 *      an alignment they're accessed with, and have references to each built
 *      (part 3). Each built reference comes with a guard that is true when the
 *      pointer variable points at that data object, which are used to combine
 *      all referred to objects into one object (as a gigantic 'if' chain).
 *   3) Reference building -- this is where all the dirty work is. Given a data
 *      object, and a (possibly nondeterminstic) offset, this code must create
 *      an expression that evaluates to the value in the data object, at the
 *      given offset, with the desired type of this dereference.
 *   4) Assertions: We encode assertion that the offset being accessed lies
 *      withing the data object being referred to, but also that the access has
 *      the correct alignment, and doesn't access padding bytes.
 *
 *  A particular point of interest is the byte layout of the data objects we're
 *  dealing with. The underlying SMT objects mean nothing during byte
 *  addressing, only the code in 'type_byte_size' is relevant. To aid
 *  dereferencing, that code ensures that all data objects are word aligned in
 *  all struct fields (and that trailing padding exists). This is so that we
 *  can avoid all scenarios where dereferences cross field boundries, as that
 *  will ultimately be an alignment violation.
 *
 *  The value set tracking code also maintains a 'minimum alignment' piece of
 *  data when the offset is nondeterministic, guarenteeing that the offset used
 *  will be aligned to at least that many bytes. This allows for reducing the
 *  number of behaviours we have to support when dereferencing, particularly
 *  useful when accessing array elements.
 *
 *  The majority of code is in the reference building stuff. It would be aimless
 *  to document all it's ecentricities, but here are a few guidelines:
 *   * There are two different flavours of offsets, the offset of the pointer
 *     being dereferenced, and the offset caused by the expression that's
 *     dereferencing it.
 *   * 'Scalar step lists' are a list of expressions applied to a struct or
 *     array to access a scalar within the base object. For example, the expr
 *     "foo->bar[baz]" dereferences foo and applies a member then index expr.
 *     The idea behind this is that we can directly pull the scalar value out
 *     of the underlying type if possible, instead of having to compute a
 *     reference to a struct or array in dereference code.
 *   * In that vein, building a reference to a struct only happens as a last
 *     resort, and is vigorously asserted against. An exception to this rule
 *     is when the underlying object is a byte array: we have to support this
 *     so that one can malloc memory for structure objects.
 *   * Sometimes in the worst case scenario, we're unable to access a data
 *     object in any sane way (like an int access to a short array), and end up
 *     needing to reconstruct the desired type from the byte representation.
 *     This tends to get referred to as 'stitching it together from bytes'.
