# ESBMC Static Build Guide

This is a guide on how to build ESBMC and its supported solvers.

It has been tested with Ubuntu 20.04.1, Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS Catalina as well as [Windows 10 WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) v1 or v2 [Ubuntu WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl), but the steps are mostly the same for other Linux and macOS distributions.

It is recommended that the RAM should be 6 GB at least.

Before starting, note that ESBMC is mainly distributed under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), so please read it carefully.

## Installing build tools and basic dependencies

We need to install some dependencies before moving into the next steps.

All of them are listed in the following installation command:

```
Linux:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential git gperf libgmp-dev cmake bison curl flex g++-multilib linux-libc-dev libboost-all-dev libtinfo-dev ninja-build python3-setuptools unzip wget python3-pip openjdk-8-jre

macOS:
brew install gmp cmake boost ninja python3 wget automake flex bison && pip3 install PySMT
```

Note that the packages are listed with their name in Debian/Ubuntu, but they can be found in other distributions as well.

## Cloning ESBMC Source Code

ESBMC source code is publicly available in [Github](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc).

Before Cloning ESBMC Source Code, it is better to make a directory to contain the whole project in “ESBMC_Project”.

You can get the latest version using the following __git__ command:

```
mkdir ESBMC_Project && cd ESBMC_Project && git clone https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc
```

## Preparing Clang

Here, you have a choice: either build against the standard LLVM/Clang as
distributed by the developers or the distribution, or to use a CHERI-enabled
LLVM/Clang toolchain for ESBMC's frontend in case you want to verify CHERI-C
programs as well. Note that the CHERI-support in ESBMC is experimental and
incomplete at this point.

If you are building ESBMC-CHERI, skip the following sections and go straight to Section `Preparing CHERI Clang 13 (experimental)`.

### Preparing external standard Clang (recommended for a static build)

You can either download and unpack a release manually:

```
wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.0/clang+llvm-11.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-20.04.tar.xz &&
tar xfJ clang+llvm-11.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-20.04.tar.xz &&
ESBMC_CLANG=$(echo -D{LLVM,Clang}_DIR=$PWD/clang+llvm-11.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-20.04) &&
ESBMC_STATIC=ON
```

or use ESBMC's default for downloading dependencies during the build process:
```
ESBMC_CLANG=-DDOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES=ON
ESBMC_STATIC=ON
```

We'll use these variables later in the build process. Note that downloading
dependencies work for most of the dependencies covered below as well.
In this case, you can directly jump to the section "Building ESBMC".
Remember that it is optional to keep all the features enabled.
They are optional.

### Preparing distributed Clang (recommended for a shared build)

For shared builds, it is recommended to use the system's LLVM/Clang, which on
Ubuntu can be obtained by:
```
apt-get install libclang-cpp11-dev &&
ESBMC_CLANG="-DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-11/lib/cmake/llvm -DClang_DIR=/usr/lib/cmake/clang-11" &&
ESBMC_STATIC=OFF
```

### Preparing CHERI Clang 13 (experimental)

CHERI-enabled ESBMC uses [__CHERI clang__](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/llvm-project) in its front-end. It currently supports the release 20210817 based on clang version 13.0.0.

First, we need to download the package. It can be performed using the following __wget__ command:

```
wget https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/llvm-project/archive/refs/tags/cheri-rel-20210817.tar.gz
```

Then, we need to extract and build the package. You can use the following commands:

```
tar xf cheri-rel-20210817.tar.gz &&
mkdir clang13 &&
cd llvm-project-cheri-rel-20210817 &&
mkdir build &&
cd build &&
cmake -GNinja -S ../llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=4 -DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=FALSE -DLLVM_INSTALL_BINUTILS_SYMLINKS=TRUE -DLLVM_ENABLE_LIBXML2=FALSE -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=FORCE_ON -DLLVM_ENABLE_OCAMLDOC=FALSE -DLLVM_ENABLE_BINDINGS=FALSE -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=FALSE -DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=FALSE -DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=FALSE -DCLANG_ENABLE_STATIC_ANALYZER=FALSE -DCLANG_ENABLE_ARCMT=FALSE -DLLVM_ENABLE_Z3_SOLVER=FALSE -DLLVM_TOOL_LLVM_MCA_BUILD=FALSE -DLLVM_TOOL_LLVM_EXEGESIS_BUILD=FALSE -DLLVM_TOOL_LLVM_RC_BUILD=FALSE -DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=TRUE -DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=FALSE -DLLVM_USE_SPLIT_DWARF=TRUE -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=TRUE '-DLLVM_LIT_ARGS=--max-time 3600 --timeout 300 -s -vv' '-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=AArch64;ARM;Mips;RISCV;X86;host' -DENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_NEW_PASS_MANAGER=FALSE -DCLANG_ROUND_TRIP_CC1_ARGS=FALSE '-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=llvm;clang;lld' -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../clang13 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/c++ -DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER=/usr/bin/cc -DCMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN=TRUE
ninja &&
ninja install &&
cd ../.. &&
ESBMC_CLANG=$(echo -D{LLVM,Clang}_DIR=$PWD/clang13) &&
ESBMC_STATIC=ON
```

## Preparing the Solidity frontend (optional)

We developed a solidity frontend for the efficient SMT-based context-bounded model checker (ESBMC). ESBMC-solidity is a permissively licensed open-source context-bounded model checker to verify Solidity smart contracts. It can verify both predefined safety properties (e.g., bounds check, overflow, underflow) and user-defined program assertions automatically.

To verify Solidity smart contract, ESBMC should be built with the option:

```
-DENABLE_SOLIDITY_FRONTEND=On
```

## Preparing the Python frontend (optional)

The Python frontend enables the analysis of Python code, leveraging the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated by ast2json Python package.

To use the Python frontend, follow these steps:

First __install ast2json:__
```bash
pip3 install ast2json
```

then __enable the Python frontend__ during the ESBMC build:
```
-DENABLE_PYTHON_FRONTEND=On
```

## Preparing IBEX as the constraint programming solver for interval contraction (optional)

ESBMC can use the forward and backward operations from constraint programming to contract the search space exploration from the program's entry point to the property being verified and vice-versa. This (interval) contraction is enabled via the option --goto-contractor. First, the IBEX library must be installed using the instructions available at http://ibex-team.github.io/ibex-lib/install.html. Once IBEX is installed on your computer, ESBMC should be built with the option:

```
-DENABLE_GOTO_CONTRACTOR=ON -DIBEX_DIR=path-to-ibex
```

## Setting Up Solvers

ESBMC relies on SMT solvers to reason about formulae in its back-end.

Currently we support the following solvers: __Bitwuzla__, __Boolector__, __CVC4__, __MathSAT__, __Yices 2__, and __Z3__.

Since this guide focuses primarily on ESBMC build, we will only cover the steps needed by it.

Note that all solvers are optional, and you don't need to enable them. However,
without any solver, ESBMC will not be able to verify many programs. It is
recommended to include at least the SMT solver Boolector.

### Setting Up Boolector

We have wrapped the entire build and setup of Boolector in the following command:

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch=3.2.3 https://github.com/boolector/boolector && cd boolector && ./contrib/setup-lingeling.sh && ./contrib/setup-btor2tools.sh && ./configure.sh --prefix $PWD/../boolector-release && cd build && make -j9 && make install && cd .. && cd ..
```

For more details on Boolector, please refer to [its Github](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector).

### Setting Up CVC4 (Linux Only)

We have wrapped the entire build and setup of CVC4 in the following command:

```
pip3 install toml && git clone https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4.git && cd CVC4 && git reset --hard b826fc8ae95fc && ./contrib/get-antlr-3.4 && ./configure.sh --optimized --prefix=../cvc4 --static --no-static-binary && cd build && make -j4 && make install && cd .. && cd ..
```

If you need more details on CVC4, please refer to [its Github](https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4).

### Setting Up MathSAT

We have wrapped the entire build and setup of MathSAT in the following command:

```
Linux:
wget http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.php?file=mathsat-5.5.4-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -O mathsat.tar.gz && tar xf mathsat.tar.gz && mv mathsat-5.5.4-linux-x86_64 mathsat

macOS:
wget http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.php?file=mathsat-5.5.4-darwin-libcxx-x86_64.tar.gz -O mathsat.tar.gz && tar xf mathsat.tar.gz && mv mathsat-5.5.4-darwin-libcxx-x86_64 mathsat
```

In macOS, the following command is required:

```
ln -s /usr/local/include/gmp.h mathsat/include/gmp.h
```

For more details on MathSAT, please refer to [its webpage](https://mathsat.fbk.eu).

### Setting Up Yices

First, we need to setup and build [GMP library](https://gmplib.org), by entering the following command (Linux only):

```
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz && tar xf gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz && rm gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz && cd gmp-6.1.2 && ./configure --prefix $PWD/../gmp --disable-shared ABI=64 CFLAGS=-fPIC CPPFLAGS=-DPIC && make -j4 && make install && cd ..
```

Then, we are able to build and setup Yices 2 using the following command:

```
Linux:
git clone https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2.git && cd yices2 && git checkout Yices-2.6.1 && autoreconf -fi && ./configure --prefix $PWD/../yices --with-static-gmp=$PWD/../gmp/lib/libgmp.a && make -j9 && make static-lib && make install && cp ./build/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-release/static_lib/libyices.a ../yices/lib && cd ..

macOS:
git clone https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2.git && cd yices2 && git checkout Yices-2.6.1 && autoreconf -fi && ./configure --prefix $PWD/../yices && make -j9 && make static-lib && make install && cp ./build/x86_64-apple-darwin*release/static_lib/libyices.a ../yices/lib && cd ..
```

If you need more details on Yices 2, please refer to [its Github](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2).

### Setting Up Z3

We have wrapped the entire build and setup of Z3 in the following command:

```
Linux:
wget https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/download/z3-4.8.9/z3-4.8.9-x64-ubuntu-16.04.zip && unzip z3-4.8.9-x64-ubuntu-16.04.zip && mv z3-4.8.9-x64-ubuntu-16.04 z3

macOS:
brew install z3
```

If you need more details on Z3, please refer to [its Github](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

If you are using macOS and have installed z3 using brew, you'll need to copy the entire z3 directory from the place where Homebrew keeps packages to your workspace:

```
cp -rp $(brew info z3 | egrep "/usr[/a-zA-Z\.0-9]+ " -o) z3
```

### Setting Up Bitwuzla

We have wrapped the entire build and setup of Bitwuzla in the following command:

```
Linux/macOS:
git clone --depth=1 --branch=0.3.1 https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla.git && cd bitwuzla && ./configure.py --prefix $PWD/../bitwuzla-release && cd build && meson install
```

For more details on Bitwuzla, please refer to [its Github](https://github.com/bitwuzla/bitwuzla).

Before proceeding to the next section, make sure you have clang, LLVM and all the solvers ready in your workspace:

```
clang and LLVM:
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/clang13

Boolector:
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/boolector

CVC4: (Linux only)
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/CVC4

MathSAT:
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/mathsat

Yices:
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/yices

Z3:
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/z3

Bitwuzla:
<path_to_your_project>/ESBMC_Project/bitwuzla
```

The above paths will be used in ESBMC's build command in the next section.

If you are using macOS, make sure you have Xcode.app in your Applications directory by checking:

```
ls /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/
```

If no such directory, please go to App Store and install Xcode. If you do not have the full version of Xcode, you will need to replace the flag `C2GOTO` with:

```
-DC2GOTO_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
```

## Building ESBMC

Now we are ready to build ESBMC. Please note that we describe the same build option used in our CI/CD. If you want to all available _cmake_ options, refer to our [Options.cmake file](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc/blob/master/scripts/cmake/Options.cmake).

If you are building ESBMC-CHERI, please complete the following sections BEFORE configuring ESBMC-CHERI:
- Preparing CHERI Clang 13 (experimental)
  - This section helps you to build CHERI-LLVM and set up `ESBMC_CLANG`.
- Setting up the sysroot for CHERI clang
  - This section will get you the CHERI header files to set up `ESBMC_CHERI_HYBRID_SYSROOT` and `ESBMC_CHERI_PURECAP_SYSROOT`.

First, we need to setup __cmake__, by using the following command in ESBMC_Project directory you just created:

```
Linux:
cd esbmc && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -GNinja -DBUILD_TESTING=On -DENABLE_REGRESSION=On $ESBMC_CLANG -DBUILD_STATIC=${ESBMC_STATIC:-ON} -DBoolector_DIR=$PWD/../../boolector-release -DZ3_DIR=$PWD/../../z3 -DENABLE_MATHSAT=ON -DMathsat_DIR=$PWD/../../mathsat -DENABLE_YICES=On -DYices_DIR=$PWD/../../yices -DCVC4_DIR=$PWD/../../cvc4 -DGMP_DIR=$PWD/../../gmp -DBitwuzla_DIR=$PWD/../../bitwuzla-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$PWD/../../release

macOS:
cd esbmc && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -GNinja -DBUILD_TESTING=On -DENABLE_REGRESSION=On -DBUILD_STATIC=${ESBMC_STATIC:-ON} $ESBMC_CLANG -DBoolector_DIR=$PWD/../../boolector-release -DZ3_DIR=$PWD/../../z3 -DENABLE_MATHSAT=On -DMathsat_DIR=$PWD/../../mathsat -DENABLE_YICES=ON -DYices_DIR=$PWD/../../yices -DC2GOTO_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk -DBitwuzla_DIR=$PWD/../../bitwuzla-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$PWD/../../release
```

Note, this command uses the ESBMC_CLANG and ESBMC_STATIC variables set in the section on preparing Clang. Note also that if you want to enable the debug mode, i.e., the internal assertions in ESBMC, you must add the option `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

Finally, we can trigger the build process by using the following command:

```
cmake --build . && ninja install
```

Once it is finished, ESBMC should be available in the _release_ folder.

## Notes on old frontends

In addition to the clang frontends, ESBMC also has two old frontends, `src/ansi-c` for C and `src/cpp` for C++. These old frontends can be built with __cmake__ flag `-DENABLE_OLD_FRONTEND=On`. To use the old frontend for verification, use the ESBMC command line option `--old-frontend`.

# ESBMC Shared Builds

It is also possible to build a non-static version of ESBMC that links to
system libraries and/or solvers installed system-wide.

Shared linking is the default when __cmake__ is invoked with
`-DBUILD_STATIC=Off` or the variable is not set.

## Notes on shared Clang

When __clang__ has been built with the __cmake__ setting
`CLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB=On`, the default is to link against the dynamic library
`libclang-cpp` and also to not bundle __clang__'s header files.
This bundling can be controlled by setting the __cmake__ variable
`CLANG_HEADERS_BUNDLED` to `On` or `Off` instead of its default `detect`.

`On` means that the headers are always bundled in ESBMC's executables, and
`Off` never bundles the headers, but hard-codes their path. Not bundling headers
when linking shared against a system installation of __clang__ speeds up ESBMC's
translation of source files by avoiding the creation of a temporary directory
and extracting the bundled headers to it. As is common with runtime dependencies
on shared libraries, when __clang__ is updated to a new version, ESBMC will need
to be recompiled.

It is advised to keep the default setting `detect` for `CLANG_HEADERS_BUNDLED`,
which decides to bundle headers only when linking statically against __clang__.

## Setting up the sysroot for CHERI clang

CHERI clang is used as frontend by CHERI-enabled ESBMC.
Since CHERI support is available only for a few platforms, verifying CHERI-C
programs that use header files from the C standard library will require a setup
of a C standard library for one of these platforms.

To obtain and install a CHERI sysroot, the
[cheribuild](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild)
tool is the recommended way:
```
cheribuild.py cheribsd-riscv64-purecap disk-image-riscv64-purecap -d
```
Once the build completed, you'll find `cheri` directory in your HOME directory.

CHERI-enabled ESBMC defaults to the platform mips64-unknown-freebsd and
expects the corresponding sysroot, the default of which can be configured by
passing the CMake flags
```
-DESBMC_CHERI_HYBRID_SYSROOT=<path> -DESBMC_CHERI_PURECAP_SYSROOT=<path>
```
e.g. the 'path' should point to `$HOME/cheri/output/rootfs-riscv64-purecap`. As for the `rootfs-riscv64-purecap` part, you may want to use a diffrent directory if you used a different variant in the `cheribuild.py` command above.
