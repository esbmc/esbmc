# Supported features: 
ESBMC v7 supports the following C++ features:
- Class
- C++ New and Delete: Dangling pointer, Double delete and Mismatched operators
- constructors and destructors
- lvalue reference
- rvalue reference
- Move semantics: Move constructor, Move assignment operator.
- C++ OM fixed: string_view, algorithm, vector, Typeinfo, iterator, string, queue, numeric, set
- Standard lib: <type_traits>
- Improved references and Temporary object
- New Clang node
   * DefaultInit Expr
   * sizeof Expr
   * C++ 11 nullptr_t Expr
   * C++ 17 variable template declarations
- template
   * [x] Umbrella issue: https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc/issues/989 (original estimate 2-3 weeks, logged 2.5 weeks)
     
- inheritance and polymorphism:
   * [x] single-level polymorhism
   * [x] multi-level polymorhism
   * [x] pure virtual method
   * [x] virtual inheritance (the diamond problem)
   * [ ] correct order of ctors/dtors: 
     * tracked by the umbrella issue [issue 940](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc/issues/940), affected features are listed below: 
       * Virtual destructor 
       * Base initialization for the most-derivied class
       * Order of destruction in case of object composition (part-whole relationship)

- (TODO) Exception handling:
   * [x] try-catch, throw

# Development Tracking: 
The new clang-based frontend is under development. We are currently working to pass the benchmark `regression/esbmc-cpp/cpp` which contains 370 test cases. Please see benchmark stats in each subsection. 

The stats are generated by applying the following commands in the benchmark logs from Github workflow "Run a Benchmark": 

To generate stats about error signatures: 
```
egrep "Assertion|ERROR" * -rn | egrep -v "//" | cut -d':' -f3- | sort | uniq -c
```

To generate stats about passes: 
```
egrep "VERIFICATION FAILED|VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL" * -rn | rev | cut -d ':' -f 1 | rev | sort | uniq -c
```

The following lines are used to fix the TCs, and added here for future reference: 
The commands below are for future reference: 
Fix the include path for Linux CIs: 
```bash
egrep "\-I ~/libraries" . -rl | xargs sed -i 's/-I \~\/libraries/-I \/__w\/esbmc\/esbmc\/src\/cpp\/library/g'
```
Add tag for each TC in a test suite: 
```python
from pathlib import Path
for path in Path('./').rglob('test.desc'):
    print(path)
    f = open(path,'r')
    lines = f.readlines()[:-1]
    lines.append("<item_10_mode>KNOWNBUG</item_10_mode>" + "\n")
    lines.append("</test-case>")
    f.close()
    f = open(path,'w')
    f.writelines(lines)
```


# Tracking Error Signatures for esbmc-cpp/cpp test suite:
Since we've added the support for most of the key features, most, if not all, errors are of the type `PARSE ERRORS` in our OMs for STL test suites. There's no need to track parse errors for those test suites. See section `Summary of Pass Rate in Each Test Suite` for the most up-to-date pass rate. 

# Build LLVM from source:
Using a debug build of clang greatly helps debugging the clang-based C++ converter in ESBMC. 
See Rafael's guide in https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc/wiki/Windows-Build#llvm
