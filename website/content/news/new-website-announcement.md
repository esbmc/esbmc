🚀 Exciting News! We are pleased to announce our new
[ESBMC website](esbmc.github.io).

ESBMC 🔍 is a mature, permissively licensed open-source SMT-based bounded model
checker for C, C++, Rust, and Solidity programs, verifying both single and
multi-threaded software and detecting bugs such as division by zero, pointer
safety, overflow, memory leaks, and more.

Before this update, the documentation and news was fragmented across several
websites:

- ssvlab.github.io/esbmc
- github.com/esbmc/esbmc/wiki
- esbmc.github.io/esbmc

The new site consolidates all documentation, tutorials, news, and downloads into
a single, up-to-date location 📚🔗. We aim to keep this website as up-to-date as
possible!

Check it out and let us know what you think 🎆!
